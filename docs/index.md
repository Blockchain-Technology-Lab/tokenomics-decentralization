# Tokenomics Blockchain Decentralization - Documentation

This is the documentation for the Tokenomics Decentralization Analysis tool developed by the University of Edinburgh's 
Blockchain Technology Lab. The tool is responsible for analyzing the token distribution of various blockchains and measuring their 
subsequent levels of decentralization.

The relevant source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Blockchain-Technology-Lab/tokenomics-decentralization).

## Overview

Currently, the supported ledgers are:

- Bitcoin
- Bitcoin Cash
- Cardano
- Dogecoin
- Ethereum 
- Litecoin
- Tezos

We intend to add more ledgers to this list in the future.
