# The snapshots for which an analysis should be performed.
# Each snapshot is a string of the form YYYY-MM-DD.
# If granularity is also set, then the analysis will run on the timeframe of the two farthest snapshots.

  - "2020"

# The granularity for the analysis when two dates are provided in the --snapshot_dates argument (which are then interpreted as start and end dates). 
# It can be one of: "day", "week", "month", "year", or empty. If empty, then only the snapshots for the given dates will be analyzed.
